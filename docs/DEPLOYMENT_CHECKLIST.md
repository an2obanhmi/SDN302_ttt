## üöÄ Vercel Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Repository
```bash
# Ensure all changes are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for production deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your repository
5. Configure project settings

### Step 3: Environment Variables
In Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | `your-secure-secret-key` | Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | `https://your-domain.vercel.app` | Your production domain |
| `MONGODB_URI` | `mongodb+srv://...` | Your MongoDB Atlas connection string |

### Step 4: Deploy
1. Click "Deploy" in Vercel dashboard
2. Wait for build to complete
3. Check deployment logs for errors

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. Basic Functionality
- [ ] Home page loads
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Products page displays
- [ ] Authentication pages accessible

### 2. Authentication Flow
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] User login works
- [ ] Session persistence
- [ ] Logout functionality

### 3. Product Management
- [ ] View products (public)
- [ ] Create products (authenticated)
- [ ] Edit products (authenticated)
- [ ] Delete products (authenticated)

### 4. Security Testing
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login
- [ ] API endpoints return 401 for unauthenticated requests
- [ ] UI shows/hides features based on auth state

### 5. Performance
- [ ] Page load times acceptable
- [ ] API response times good
- [ ] No build errors in production

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

#### 1. Build Failures
```bash
# Check build locally first
npm run build

# Common fixes:
# - Fix TypeScript errors
# - Update dependencies
# - Check import paths
```

#### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
# Verify in Vercel dashboard:
# - All variables are set
# - No typos in variable names
# - Values are correct
```

#### 3. Database Connection
```bash
# Check MongoDB Atlas:
# - Network access allows Vercel IPs
# - User has proper permissions
# - Connection string is correct
```

#### 4. Authentication Issues
```bash
# Verify NextAuth configuration:
# - NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set
# - NEXTAUTH_URL matches production domain
# - MongoDB connection works
```

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Vercel Analytics
- [ ] Enable Vercel Analytics
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Track API performance
- [ ] Monitor error rates

### Database Monitoring
- [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas alerts
- [ ] Monitor connection pool usage
- [ ] Track query performance
- [ ] Set up backup alerts

## üîí Security Checklist

### Production Security
- [x] HTTPS enabled (automatic with Vercel)
- [x] Environment variables secured
- [x] API endpoints protected
- [x] Input validation active
- [x] Error messages sanitized

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error logging
- [ ] Monitor authentication attempts
- [ ] Track API usage
- [ ] Set up security alerts

## üìù Final Verification

### Assignment 2 Requirements
- [x] User registration/login ‚úÖ
- [x] Product CRUD with authentication ‚úÖ
- [x] Proper access control ‚úÖ
- [x] All required API endpoints ‚úÖ
- [x] Complete UI with auth features ‚úÖ

### Production Readiness
- [x] Build successful
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Security implemented
- [x] Performance optimized
- [x] Documentation complete

## üéâ Deployment Complete

Once all checklist items are completed:

1. **Share the production URL**
